1,"**Feedback Bot:** Hello! I'm here to gather your feedback about the ABC degree program. This should only take a few minutes. Let's start with your overall experience - how satisfied are you with the ABC degree program on a scale of 1-10?

**Student:** I'd say about a 7. It's been pretty good overall, but there are definitely some areas that could be improved.

**Feedback Bot:** Thank you for that rating. What aspects of the program do you find most satisfying, and what would you like to see improved?

**Student:** I really like the practical components and the variety of topics we cover. But sometimes the workload feels uneven between semesters, and some courses feel disconnected from each other.

**Feedback Bot:** That's valuable feedback. Now I have some questions about course structure preferences. Do you prefer courses worth 5 credit points or 10 credit points?

**Student:** Definitely 5 CP courses. The 10 CP ones feel too overwhelming and it's harder to balance multiple subjects when one takes up so much time.

**Feedback Bot:** Understood. What about language of instruction - do you prefer classes taught in English or German?

**Student:** I actually like having both options available. English is good for accessing international research and resources, but German classes sometimes allow for deeper discussion since it's my native language.

**Feedback Bot:** Great point about having options. Finally, regarding assessment methods - do you prefer multiple graded assignments throughout the semester or one comprehensive final exam?

**Student:** Multiple assignments for sure. It reduces stress and gives you a better chance to actually learn the material instead of just cramming everything at the end.

**Feedback Bot:** Perfect. Thank you for your time and honest feedback about the ABC degree program. Your responses will help us improve the program for future students. Have a great day!

**Student:** Thanks, glad I could help!"

**Student:** Hmm, I'd give it a 9. I'm really happy with my choice to study ABC here.

**Feedback Bot:** That's excellent to hear! What aspects of the program do you find most satisfying, and what would you like to see improved?

**Student:** The professors are fantastic and really accessible. The curriculum feels current and relevant. If anything, maybe we could use more networking opportunities with industry professionals.

**Feedback Bot:** Great suggestion about industry networking. Now I have some questions about course structure preferences. Do you prefer courses worth 5 credit points or 10 credit points?

**Student:** I actually prefer the 10 CP courses. You can really dive deep into a topic and it feels more immersive. Plus, fewer courses to juggle at once.

**Feedback Bot:** Interesting perspective. What about language of instruction - do you prefer classes taught in English or German?

**Student:** English, definitely. I'm planning to work internationally after graduation, so it's good practice. Plus, a lot of the cutting-edge research is published in English anyway.

**Feedback Bot:** That makes sense for your career goals. Finally, regarding assessment methods - do you prefer multiple graded assignments throughout the semester or one comprehensive final exam?

**Student:** One big exam, actually. I know that's probably unpopular, but I like having the whole semester to focus on learning without worrying about constant deadlines. Then I can really show what I've mastered in one comprehensive assessment.

**Feedback Bot:** That's a unique perspective, thank you! Your feedback about the ABC degree program is very helpful. We appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts.

**Student:** No problem, happy to help improve the program!"
3,"**Feedback Bot:** Hello! I'm here to gather your feedback about the ABC degree program. This should only take a few minutes. Let's start with your overall experience - how satisfied are you with the ABC degree program on a scale of 1-10?

**Student:** Honestly? Maybe a 5. It's been okay but not what I expected.

**Feedback Bot:** I appreciate your honesty. What aspects of the program do you find most satisfying, and what would you like to see improved?

**Student:** The theory is solid, I'll give it that. But there's way too much theory and not enough hands-on experience. Also, some professors seem out of touch with what's actually happening in the field right now.

**Feedback Bot:** That's important feedback about the theory-practice balance. Now I have some questions about course structure preferences. Do you prefer courses worth 5 credit points or 10 credit points?

**Student:** 5 CP for sure. When a 10 CP course is bad, you're stuck with it for the whole semester and it drags down everything else. At least with 5 CP courses, the damage is more contained.

**Feedback Bot:** That's a practical consideration. What about language of instruction - do you prefer classes taught in English or German?

**Student:** German, I guess. My English is fine, but when you're struggling with difficult concepts, it's easier to understand and participate in your native language. Some of the English classes feel like you're fighting the language barrier on top of the actual content.

**Feedback Bot:** That's understandable. Finally, regarding assessment methods - do you prefer multiple graded assignments throughout the semester or one comprehensive final exam?

**Student:** Multiple assignments, but not too many. Maybe 2-3 throughout the semester. One big exam is too much pressure, but having an assignment due every other week is also exhausting.

**Feedback Bot:** Thank you for that detailed feedback. Your honest assessment of the ABC degree program will help us identify areas for improvement. We value your input.

**Student:** I hope it actually leads to some changes. The program has potential, it just needs some adjustments."

**Student:** I'd say an 8. Really enjoying it overall, though there are always little things that could be better.

**Feedback Bot:** That's great to hear! What aspects of the program do you find most satisfying, and what would you like to see improved?

**Student:** I love the research opportunities and how supportive the academic community is here. The facilities are also top-notch. I wish there were more elective options though, and maybe some courses could be offered more frequently.

**Feedback Bot:** Excellent points about research and facilities. Now I have some questions about course structure preferences. Do you prefer courses worth 5 credit points or 10 credit points?

**Student:** I don't have a strong preference actually. Both have their merits. 5 CP courses give you more variety, but 10 CP courses let you really get into the nitty-gritty. Maybe a mix is best?

**Feedback Bot:** A balanced approach makes sense. What about language of instruction - do you prefer classes taught in English or German?

**Student:** I'm pretty flexible on this too. German is easier for group discussions and asking detailed questions, but English courses often have better international guest lecturers and more diverse perspectives in the classroom.

**Feedback Bot:** That's a thoughtful analysis. Finally, regarding assessment methods - do you prefer multiple graded assignments throughout the semester or one comprehensive final exam?

**Student:** Definitely multiple assignments. It keeps you engaged throughout the semester and you get feedback along the way to improve. Plus, if you have a bad day during one assignment, it's not the end of the world like it would be with a single exam.

**Feedback Bot:** That's very logical reasoning. Thank you so much for your thoughtful feedback about the ABC degree program. Your insights will be valuable for program development.

**Student:** Glad I could contribute! It's nice to see the program actively seeking student input."
5,"Transcript: Feedback Conversation on Academic Program

Coordinator (Dr. Müller): Good afternoon, thanks for taking the time to speak with me today. We’re collecting feedback on our academic program, and your input as a student is really valuable. Shall we get started?

Student (Anna): Sure, happy to help.

Dr. Müller: Great. First, overall, how have you found the structure and content of your courses this semester?

Anna: I think the content has been quite engaging, and the workload is manageable. Some courses are a bit theory-heavy, though. I’d appreciate a bit more practical application, especially in the seminars.

Dr. Müller: That’s useful to hear. We’re always trying to balance theory and practice. On that note, one area we’re reviewing is the number of credit points per course. Do you personally prefer 5 CP courses or 10 CP courses? And why?

Anna: Hmm… I think I prefer 10 CP courses. It feels more rewarding to invest time and go deeper into one subject rather than splitting attention between too many 5 CP courses. It also makes scheduling easier.

Dr. Müller: That makes sense. Some students have expressed similar thoughts, especially regarding workload distribution. Now, regarding the language of instruction: do you prefer classes to be taught in English or German?

Anna: I actually prefer English. I think it's helpful not just academically but also for career prospects. Most of the literature and materials are in English anyway, so it feels more natural to continue in that language.

Dr. Müller: Understood. We’ve seen a growing trend towards English-taught courses, especially in the international programs. Would you feel comfortable if more advanced seminars were offered only in English?

Anna: Yes, definitely. As long as there’s some support for students who might struggle a bit with academic English, I think that would be a good move.

Dr. Müller: That’s helpful. Let me ask a few more questions if that’s alright.

Anna: Of course.

Dr. Müller: How satisfied are you with the availability and responsiveness of the teaching staff?

Anna: Overall, quite satisfied. Most professors respond to emails quickly and are open to questions during office hours. However, in larger lectures, it’s sometimes hard to get individual feedback unless you make an extra effort.

Dr. Müller: Thank you. We’ll keep that in mind. Another topic we’re reviewing is digital tools. How do you feel about the use of digital platforms like Moodle, Zoom, or lecture recordings?

Anna: I really appreciate recorded lectures and Moodle resources. It helps me review the material at my own pace. Zoom is okay for seminars, but I still prefer in-person discussions when possible.

Dr. Müller: That’s a good balance. One last question: have you had enough opportunities to apply your knowledge in real-world settings, like internships, project work, or case studies?

Anna: Honestly, not really. I think more structured opportunities—maybe embedded internships or partnerships with companies—would be great. Right now, you really have to seek those out yourself.

Dr. Müller: That’s great feedback. Thank you again for your honesty and time, Anna.

Anna: You’re welcome! I’m glad to contribute."
